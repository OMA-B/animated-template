# animated-template

It's nothing much... since;

__a predefined template from https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation was used

__then formatted with https://htmlformatter.com/

__only made few adjustments/tweaks

I know, I know, sounds boring, but;

__it's not bad coming to know the usefulness already made libraries, in which https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ came in really handy

So, I could say I learned few new things. (wink)

Since it's not entirely my code, I can't vouch you'll find it easy to comprehend, just like I was muzzled at first...

But if get perplexed at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
